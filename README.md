## Introduction

As they say – well begun is half done.  So, I write simple program in Java. Why? Because I wanted to try, AND I did it! Knowing how to write, compile and execute code is a skill I'll need throughout my professional career. In this course, I've learned how to create software programs using standard coding structures and processes such as variables, constants, operators, decision logic, iteration constructs, and functions. For this assignment, I wrote an application using the Java programming language. 

My program count index BMI it’s one project, one class and six methods. I use a Imperial BMI Formula 

BMI = 703 × weight (lbs) / height (in)* height (in) 

```
This program calculates index BMI 

{ 

In the main function 

     Call function welcomeMessage(); 

     Make Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); 

     Call function with arguments weight = UserInput(in, "What your Weight? (lb)"); height = UserInput(in, "What your Height? (in)"); bmi = CountBmi(weight, height); CastingBmi(in, bmi); compareBMI(bmi);      

} 

 

   

function welcomeMessage(){ 

Welcome message 

} 

function UserInput(Argument one, Argument two){ 

    Initial variable height/weight, check that the input value is not 0, if 0, processing the error and resets this scanner. 

   

    return double variables 

end 

} 

function CountBmi (Argument one, Argument two){ 

    Count BMI in Imperial BMI Formula 

    BMI = weight (lb) * 703 / (height (in)*(height (in)) 

   

    return double variable 

end 

} 

function compareBMI (Argument one, Argument two){ 

    If 1 print response "You have a Very severely underweight" 

    If 2 print response "You have a Severely underweight" 

    If 3 print response "You have a Underweight" 

    If 3 print response "You have a Normal (healthy weight)" 

    If 4 print response "You have a Overweight" 

    If 5 print response "You have a Moderately obese" 

    If 6 print response "You have a Severely obese" 

    If 7 print response "You have a Very severely obese"  

end 

} 

function CastingBmi (Argument one, Argument two){ 

    Casting int to double, ask user how value show for him 

    If 1 print response "Your BMI is " + intBmi 

    If 2 print response "Your BMI is " + bmi 

    return variable 

end 

}
