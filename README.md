## Introduction

As they say – well begun is half done.  So, I write simple program in Java. Why? Because I wanted to try, AND I did it! Knowing how to write, compile and execute code is a skill I'll need throughout my professional career. In this course, I've learned how to create software programs using standard coding structures and processes such as variables, constants, operators, decision logic, arrays, iteration constructs, and functions. For this assignment, I wrote an application using the Java programming language. 

My program count index BMI it’s one project, one class and six methods. I use a Imperial BMI Formula 

BMI = 703 × weight (lbs) / [height (in)]* [height (in)]
